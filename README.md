# Infovisplatform

## Brief introduction
This project is a runplatform combined with the experimental design tool: [NexP](https://github.com/mengxj08/webnexp).  

The experiment is to compare two visualization techniques: Scatterplots and Parallel Coordinate Plots. This [paper](http://www.shengdongzhao.com/publication/tracing-tuples-across-dimensions-a-comparison-of-scatterplots-and-parallel-coordinate-plots/) from our lab was published in EuroVis.
